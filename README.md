# Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

## Description

This project is a clone of Iternet Relay Chat (IRC), a real time messaging app where people can join channels to chat with a group of people. The access of this kind of service requires the use of a client application that connects to the IRC through a server application. We can find a bunch of RFC's about the implementation of such application, but in this repository you will find a simplified version implemented during a computer network class in Universidade de Bras√≠lia (UnB).

## Setup

First you need to install all dependencies

- npm install

Then you should start the server

- node server.js

After that you can acess the site at

- localhost:3000

## Commands

These are the functionalities implemented. You can use the graphic interface to call all the actions or type them in the terminal embedded in the application. More details regarding these commands can be found [here](docs/implementation.pdf)

- help
- nick
- leave
- list
- join
- create
- delete
- away
- msg
- ban
- kick
- clear
- file
- list_files
- get_file
