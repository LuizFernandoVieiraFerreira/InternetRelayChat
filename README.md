# Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

## Description

This project is a clone of Iternet Relay Chat (IRC), a real time messaging app where people can join channels to chat with a group of people. The access of this kind of service requires the use of a client application that connects to the IRC through a server application. We can find a bunch of RFC's about the implementation of such application, but in this repository you will find a simplified version implemented during a computer network class in Universidade de Bras√≠lia (UnB).
